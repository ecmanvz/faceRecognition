# faceRecognition
The implementation processes are using the Python programming language. The OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) Library, which is an open source library, and the Deepface Library were used. As a result, face recognition from photo and real-time face recognition applications. HoG-CNN, Eigenfaces-Fisherfaces-LBPH, DeepFaceâ€“Facenet starts face recognition processes in practice.

## Getting Started

You must have Python programming knowledge and the necessary run editor.

### Prerequisites

```javascript

# pip install --user opencv-contrib-python

```

### Installing

```javascript
#FaceNet and Deepface by using Deepface Library

from deepface import DeepFace
import cv2

###model_name = "Facenet512", "OpenFace", "DeepFace", "VGG-Face", "Facenet"
###detector_backend = "ssd", "opencv","mtcnn", "retinaface", "dlib"
###distance_metric =  "euclidean", "euclidean_l2","cosine"

```

And repeat

```javascript
import cv2
import numpy as np
import os
from sys import exit
```


## Running the tests

```javascript
def face_detection(image_to_detect): //face detection

```

### And coding style tests



```javascript
classify_image = cv2.imread("dataset/test/sancartest2.jfif")
```

## Deployment


```javascript
cv2.imshow("Fisherfaces Tahmin "+name, cv2.resize(classify_image, (500,500)))
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
